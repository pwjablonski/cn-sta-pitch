###### Premise

Modeled after popular reality shows like *Rhythm and Flow*, *The Voice*, and *Next in Fashion*, each week students will:
1. Be given a challenge based on a company client.
2. Work in teams to create a stunning web design product by the end of the week.
3. Present their work in a mini-showcase each week all culminating in a final showcase at the end of the summer.

Note: hi peter!
Hi!
does the goal as its written sound too clunky? because i think it does 
yeah that I like the ending part though
One th
what do you feel needs to be added/taken out (other than the goal which im rewording now)
I am goin to go through and write some notes
which we can add under Note: on each slide.
I think it looks great!!

cool! sounds good
I think we are a 6 weeks now :/

oh thats right. because they are doing orientation earlier 
yup
cool, changed that part
So I love The Code Off, the only thing I'm thinking is how we think about what is what
as in we have a lot of names of things already with the full name being
Code Nation's Summer Tech Academy's Incubator's The Code Off
How should we be thinking about this?
no, thats a good point...hmmm. i guess we should just stick with the summer tech academy...i guess that makes the most sense ...especially since 
someone from syep expressed that they liked the name 
Summer Tech Academy?
