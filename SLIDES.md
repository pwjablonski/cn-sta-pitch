###### Premise

Modeled after popular reality shows like _Rhythm and Flow_, _The Voice_, and _Next in Fashion_, each week students will:

1. Be given a challenge based on a company client.
2. Work in teams to create a stunning web design product by the end of the week.
3. Present their work in a mini-showcase each week all culminating in a final showcase at the end of the summer.

- Visit the "client" companies their project is based around
- See what it's like to work at an actual tech company
- Engage in a hands-on tech activity
- Learn about different tech careers in "career stations" activity

Note:
I think this is kind of dry, but i am not sure what else to add, especially since we don't know exactly who the partners will be.
I have to step away for a bit but I'll go through and leave notes or small changes!
