### Premise 

Modeled after popular reality shows like Rhythm and Flow, The Voice, and Next in Fashion, each week students will:

1. Be given a challenge based on a company client.
2. Work in teams to create a stunning web design product by the end of the week.
3. Present their work in a mini-showcase each week all culminating in a final showcase at the end of the summer.

### Goal

Students will become excited by the possibilites in the tech world by engaging with their peers to create exciting projects, and engaging with actual tech companies and professionals. In addition to developing new technical skills, students will also delve deep into thought-provoking discussions about the tech industry, and thus be inspired to be active agents who can affect change within it.
