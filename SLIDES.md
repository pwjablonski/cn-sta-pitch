###### Premise

Modeled after popular reality shows like *Rhythm and Flow*, *The Voice*, and *Next in Fashion*, each week students will:
1. Be given a challenge based on a company client.
2. Work in teams to create a stunning web design product by the end of the week.
3. Present their work in a mini-showcase each week all culminating in a final showcase at the end of the summer.

Note: hi peter!
Hi!
does the goal as its written sound too clunky? because i think it does 
yeah that I like the ending part though
One th
what do you feel needs to be added/taken out (other than the goal which im rewording now)
I am goin to go through and write some notes
which we can add under Note: on each slide.
I think it looks great!!

cool! sounds good
I think we are a 6 weeks now :/

oh thats right. because they are doing orientation earlier 
yup
cool, changed that part
So I love The Code Off, the only thing I'm thinking is how we think about what is what
as in we have a lot of names of things already with the full name being
Code Nation's Summer Tech Academy's Incubator's The Code Off
How should we be thinking about this?
no, thats a good point...hmmm. i guess we should just stick with the summer tech academy...i guess that makes the most sense ...especially since 
someone from syep expressed that they liked the name 
Summer Tech Academy?
dammnit i keep messing up formatting...but yes, summer tech academy. i will say i do think incubator sounds really weird. but i guess
we cant call it an internship

Haha yeah I think of baby chicks with incubator
But yeah the first slide with the reveal should have Code Nation's Summer Tech Academy at some point

Either Code Nation's Summer Tech Academy or Summer Tech Academy's The Code Off

But I do really like The Code Off I just don't want folks to be confused with all the names

youre totally right. there are a lot of names going on. i feel like some of them are more like, internal and im not even sure yet which will
be student facing. but i like, i mean i like both. i guess CN would prefer for branding the first one you suggested 

Okay I'll noodle on this a bit

### Goal

Through working on exciting projects with their peers and getting to interact with leading tech companies, students will leave the Summer Tech Academy inspired to take part in all the tech world has to offer.  Students will also delve deep into thought-provoking discussions about the tech industry, and thus be inspired to be active agents who can affect change within it.

Note:

Looking good! - I think a stronger word then enthusiatic
Could we a have a slide before this that has a like maybe three words that convey what we are driving towards sounds good
And use this a  more detailed explanation
ie. joy, hypecited, exploration, creation
haha hypecited
 yep i can add that
haha I think
