## How do I edit my slides?

Content for slides are written in a single markdown file called `SLIDES.md`.
Editing `SLIDES.md` will update teacher and student facing slides.
To edit your slide show's content open up the `SLIDES.md` file and click the `Markdown üëÅÔ∏è` button at the top of the file.
Forgot markdown syntax? Here's a great [Markdown Cheetsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) you can use.

Here are some additional reveal.js specific syntax for editing slides.

- **New Slide** - Add `---` padded by two blank lines. This will tell reveal to make new slide
- **Notes** - Anything written under `Note:` in a slide will be considered a note and will be hidden from view. You can still view notes in speaker view by pressing `S` on the keyboard.
- **Background** - Within the slide add `<!-- .slide: data-background="#000" -->` This works for images and gifs!
- **Fragment** - If you want to display elements on a slide sequentially next to the element add`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->`
- **Code Block** - And code you want to show include it between two sets of three backticks with the correct language type

### Can I sync student slides to mirror the instructor slides?

To control students slides we have to establish a socket between the student facing slides
and the instructor slides.

1. Open index.html.js
2. Open go to [https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh](https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh) and generate a new token
3. Update the `socketData` object with the `secret` and `id` you just generated

All student facing Slides can now be controlled remotely from the instructor slide

## What else can Reveal.js do?

If you really really want to customize the slideshow settings please see [reveal.js documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
