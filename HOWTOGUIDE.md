# CN Lesson Show How To Guide

This page will give you a brief overview of how to access, navigate, edit and share your CN Lesson


## Overview

CN Lesson Plans are made using [glitch](https://glitch.com/) and [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
Each lesson plan is a self-contained repository including slides, materials and lesson plans
Let's take a look a what we've got!

**HOWTOGUIDE.md** - You're already here!

**README.md** - This is the primary teacher facing lesson plan

**SLIDES.md** - This where we write the content for the slides in markdown

**index.html** - This where we configure and serve the slide show. You shouldn't be editing this either :)
